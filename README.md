Morpher is a general purpose framework for inflection generation and morphological analysis, that lets you plug in
different transformation engine implementations for learning transformation rules of a single affix type,
and language dependent analyzer agents.

The main parts of the framework are:

* [Morpher Core](morpher-core)
* [Morpher Transformation Engines](morpher-transformation-engines)
* [Morpher Analyzer Agents](morpher-analyzer-agents)
* [Morpher Engines](morpher-engines)
* [Morpher Systems](morpher-systems)
